# nixos-modules
This is my collection of modules for the NixOS repository. Most modules are created for the stable 23.11 version unless otherwise stated in the module's readme.

I'm at the very beginning of my journey with NixOS, so I'll inevitably make mistakes or approach problems incorrectly. If you notice an error or have a different approach, please leave a comment.

Also, I'm not using flakes yet, only a little bit of Home Manager, as I'm taking baby steps in the NixOS realm.

DISCLAIMER: I do not take any responsibility for damage to your system. Please review the code before applying the module to your system.
